Since conception, the RX-7 was certainly an oddball masterpiece from the Japanese car maker. It was powered by the famed rotary engine that was highly commended for it’s uniqueness, capability in track racing and amazing power-to-displacement ratio: Over 200 horsepower from a 1.3L engine, stock!

Whether you want the FB, the FC, or the FD, any generation of the RX-7 was clearly made in a way only a car enthusiast would love. Its finicky to work with, the rotary engine has questionable reliability, the interior can get hot due to heat radiating from the engine making its way to the inside, particularly the FD. Its also quite impractical, not so luxurious, loud, burns more oil than BP from 2010, and is more complicated to operate than a cylinder-based car, with essential principles like shifting gears from 4000-5500+ RPM, redlining at least once every hundred or so miles and constant apex seal maintenance.

Despite all these complications, the owner would be rewarded with a beautiful car that has 50/50 weight distribution, a great sounding engine, fantastic agility, significant street cred, and huge levels of fun and adrenaline from driving a car that’s main mission is delivering driver enjoyment and focus.

Ford Focus RS Mk3

This image acknowledges the other 2 generations of the Ford Focus RS because those two were also clearly made for enthusiasts in mind. However, the current generation of the Ford Focus RS has to be the most enthusiast-based Focus RS. It has aspects that most car enthusiasts these days desire; delightful power, which is based off the Ford Mustang Ecoboost’s engine, practicality, as a 5 door hatch, functional dynamics that help in driving, driver aids that are more for the refinement of driving than it’s impediment, AWD that promotes grip for maximum cornering and viability in rough conditions, and most importantly, driving fun. It even has a “Drift” button that makes the automotive showboat of drifting easier than ever before yet feel insanely fun doing so!

Also, you can get all of this for a surprisingly inexpensive price. Ford really hit the spot when they made the amazing Focus RS: A fun, practical and powerful car that can be obtained for a price lower than competitors yet still provide as much greatness as higher-end competitors, if not, more. A true “bang-for-buck” car of the 21st century.

Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution/Subaru Impreza WRX STi

The iconic Japanese car rivalry, these two wonderful AWD sports sedans were certainly unlike other. Since the 1990s and when they locked eyes in the WRC, for 20 years, the war between the STi and the Evo lasted until the latter left the building, an event that many a car enthusiast lamented about.

Depending on who you are, either one would give you huge amounts of fun. Both are very popular. The Impreza WRX STi gives tons of fun and rough condition viability while retaining refinement, comfort, and the ire of your quiet-loving neighbors. The Lancer Evo, though not as refined or as luxurious as it’s rival, it can provide a lot, if not, more driver intensity and fun with it’s amazing driving dynamics and S-AWC AWD system that helps you adapt to the terrain depending on the situation.

Both are also popular tuner cars either for track or rally use, since both cars are perfectly fine with both environments. For the non car enthusiast, the Impreza WRX STi and the Lancer Evo are just overpriced iterations of what they originally are, unnecessarily fast and sometimes uncomfortable for living with. But to those who know better, they are highly rewarding to drive and own, a performance car that has budget-level pricing that has impressive practicality and good enough for every day living apart from Euro performance dailies like the Audi RS4, BMW M3 or the Mercedes C63 AMG.
